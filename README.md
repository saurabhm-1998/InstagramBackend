# Instagram Using SpringBoot

The Restaurant Management System is a web application that provides functionality for managing food items, user accounts, and orders in a restaurant setting. It allows users to sign up, sign in, view food items, place orders, and perform administrative tasks.

## Frameworks and Language Used

The project is developed using the following frameworks and languages:

Spring Boot: A Java-based framework for building web applications.

Java: The primary programming language used for developing the application


## Data Flow

The data flow in the Instagram Backend application involves the interaction between the Controller, Service, and Repository layers.

### Controller

The Controller layer handles incoming HTTP requests and manages the flow of data.
It receives user input, validates it, and invokes the appropriate methods in the Service layer.
The Controller is responsible for processing requests, handling user authentication, and rendering views.

### Service

The Service layer contains the business logic of the application.
It performs operations on the data received from the Controller.
The Service layer communicates with the Repository to fetch or store data.
It may also apply additional business rules or transformations to the data before returning it to the Controller.

### Model

The Model layer represents the data structure used in the application.
In this project, various models are defined, including Admin, AuthenticationToken, InstagramComment, InstagramFollower, InstagramFollowing, Post, PostLike, and User.
These models capture different entities and their attributes, such as user details, post information, comments, followers, and following relationships.

### Repository

The Repository layer is responsible for data storage and retrieval.
It interacts with the underlying database or data source to perform CRUD operations on the data.
In this project, each model has a corresponding Repository responsible for managing the data and providing access methods.

## Project Summary

The Instagram Backend application provides the necessary backend functionality for an Instagram-like social media platform. It follows the typical flow of data between the Controller, Service, and Repository layers to handle user requests, process business logic, and manage data storage and retrieval. The models represent various entities, including users, posts, comments, likes, and social interactions. The application can be extended to include additional features like user profiles, direct messaging, explore functionality, and advanced algorithms for personalized recommendations based on user preferences and behavior.
